## [0.9.9] - 2025-06-25

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Device Enumeration Interface Detection**: Fixed hardware device enumeration incorrectly grouping devices with similar serial numbers, causing missing I2C interfaces
  - **Root Cause**: Device grouping algorithm was too greedy when matching similar serial numbers, causing interface overwrites when multiple devices had serials differing by only one character
  - **Impact**: Devices with similar serials (e.g., "6507DA00" and "6507D300") would be incorrectly grouped together, with later devices overwriting earlier interfaces, resulting in some devices appearing to lack I2C capability
  - **Example**: Device with serial "7507D300" would show as "EDGE Interface Only" when it actually has both I2C and EDGE interfaces
  - **Solution**: Added interface conflict detection to prevent overwriting existing interfaces when grouping by similar serials - creates separate device entries instead
  - **Technical Details**:
    - Before: Similar serials blindly grouped together, later devices overwrote earlier interface assignments
    - After: Algorithm checks if interface slot is occupied before grouping, creates new device entry if conflict detected
    - Debug message: "Interface slot already occupied for device X, creating separate entry for Y"
  - **Result**: All physical devices now correctly show both I2C and EDGE interfaces when present, matching actual hardware capabilities

## [0.9.8] - 2025-06-20

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: I2C Scanning False Positives - Correct Fix**: Fixed I2C scanner reporting devices at every address due to incorrect HID response parsing offsets
  - **Root Cause**: The v0.9.6 "HID Report Parsing Off-By-One" fix was incorrect - it assumed hidapi adds a Report ID byte, but status flags are actually at index 0, not index 1
  - **Impact**: `i2c_scan()` was reading status flags from wrong offset, causing all NACK responses to be treated as success, reporting devices at every address
  - **Diagnostic Evidence**: Trace logs showed `in_buf[0]=0x02` (NAK_RECEIVED flag) but code was reading from `in_buf[1]=0x00`
  - **Solution**: Corrected `response_offsets` constants to read status flags from index 0 instead of index 1
  - **Technical Details**:
    - Before: `STATUS_FLAGS: usize = 1` (incorrect, reading 0x00)
    - After: `STATUS_FLAGS: usize = 0` (correct, reading 0x02 for NACK)
    - Also corrected `READ_LENGTH` and `READ_DATA_START` offsets accordingly
  - **Result**: I2C scanning now correctly identifies only addresses with actual responding devices (e.g., 2 devices instead of 112)
  - **Verification**: Confirmed with hardware testing showing proper NACK detection and accurate device discovery

## [0.9.7] - 2025-01-28

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: I2C Scanning False Positives**: Fixed I2C scanner reporting devices at every address due to firmware quirk handling
  - **Root Cause**: When XR2280x firmware fails to send response reports during NACK conditions, `read_timeout()` returns `Ok(0)` but code treated this as success
  - **Impact**: `i2c_scan()` incorrectly reported devices present at all addresses, making I2C device discovery completely unreliable
  - **Solution**: Added explicit check for zero bytes read case, properly converting silent firmware responses to `Error::I2cTimeout`
  - **Result**: I2C scanning now correctly identifies only addresses with actual responding devices

## [0.9.6] - 2025-01-28

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: HID Report Parsing Off-By-One Errors**: Fixed severe data corruption bugs in I2C and GPIO interrupt parsing
  - **Root Cause**: hidapi automatically prefixes HID reports with a Report ID byte, but parsing code wasn't accounting for this offset
  - **I2C Data Reading Impact**: I2C reads returned data from register N+1 instead of register N, causing incorrect sensor readings
  - **GPIO Interrupt Impact**: GPIO interrupt reports parsed wrong bytes as pin states and trigger information
  - **Technical Details**: 
    - Before: `let status_flags = in_buf[0];` (reading Report ID as status)
    - After: `let status_flags = in_buf[1];` (correctly skipping Report ID)
    - Buffer layout: `[ReportID][Flags][WrSize][RdSize][Reserved][Data...]` where ReportID is added by hidapi
  - **Solution**: Updated buffer parsing throughout `i2c_transfer()` and `parse_gpio_interrupt_report()` to skip Report ID byte
  - **Result**: I2C operations now read from correct register addresses, GPIO interrupts parse pin states correctly
- **CRITICAL: 10-bit I2C Address Encoding Bug**: Fixed incorrect bit positioning making 10-bit I2C addressing completely non-functional
  - **Root Cause**: High 2 bits of 10-bit addresses weren't shifted to correct bit positions (2:1) for I2C protocol compliance
  - **Technical Details**: 
    - Before: `((addr >> 8) & 0x03) | 0xF0` - Missing required bit shift
    - After: `(((addr >> 8) & 0x03) << 1) | 0xF0` - Proper `11110xx0` pattern encoding
    - Example fix: Address 0x150 now correctly encoded as 0xF2 instead of 0xF1
  - **Impact**: All 10-bit I2C operations were failing, devices with 10-bit addresses were completely inaccessible
  - **Added**: `TEN_BIT_ADDR` flag constant and comprehensive validation for I2C specification compliance
  - **Result**: 10-bit I2C addressing now works correctly per I2C specification with full hardware validation
- **Code Quality**: Fixed redundant pattern matching in examples (clippy warnings)
- **Documentation**: Updated misleading comments about hidapi Report ID handling and added I2C protocol compliance notes

### Performance
- **Major GPIO Performance Architecture Overhaul**: Fundamental redesign eliminating inefficient read-modify-write cycles
  - **Root Cause Analysis**: Individual GPIO operations performed full HID Feature Report read-modify-write cycles for every single-bit change
    - Each HID Feature Report transaction: ~5-10ms latency (USB control transfer setup, HID report processing, device firmware execution)
    - Traditional pattern: `gpio_set_direction()` (2 transactions) + `gpio_set_pull()` (4 transactions) + `gpio_write()` (1 transaction) = 8 transactions per pin
    - Race condition risk: Non-atomic multi-pin operations across separate read-modify-write cycles

    - **Hardware-Aware Bulk Processing**: Leveraged XR2280x register architecture for maximum efficiency with dedicated SET/CLEAR registers
    - **API Design Principles**: Backward compatibility maintained, performance transparency with clear HID transaction costs, scalable O(1) bulk operations
  - **Performance Improvements Achieved**:
    - **Transaction Count Reduction**: Single pin (1.6x faster: 5 vs 8), 4 pins (5.3x faster: 6 vs 32), 8 pins (10.7x faster: 6 vs 64)
    - **Measured Latency Improvements**: Single pin (37-40% faster), 4 pins (81-84% faster), 8 pins (90-91% faster)
    - **Scalability**: Bulk operations achieve O(1) complexity with consistent ~6 HID transaction overhead regardless of pin count
    - **Memory Safety**: No unsafe code required, all bounds checking and error handling preserved throughout optimization

### Technical Details

  - **Transaction Batching Logic**: Pull configuration combines pull-up/pull-down register operations, direction uses single register per group, level setting leverages dedicated SET/CLEAR registers
  - **API Design Principles**: Performance transparency (clear HID transaction cost documentation), ease of use (simple migration paths), scalability (O(1) bulk operations), backward compatibility (all existing functions preserved)

  - Handle `PwmParameterError` vs `PwmHardwareError` with different recovery approaches
  - Implement targeted retry logic based on specific I2C error variants
  - Provide user-friendly error messages using the detailed context in each error variant

## [0.9.5] - 2025-01-27

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: XR22802 GPIO Capability Detection**: Fixed bug where XR22802 devices were incorrectly detected as having only 8 GPIO pins instead of 32 pins
  - **Root Cause**: XR22802 devices have two USB interfaces with different serial numbers (e.g., "6507DA00" for I2C and "7507DA00" for EDGE)
  - **Impact**: Applications using GPIO pins 8-31 failed with "UnsupportedFeature" errors in v0.9.4

- **Module Exports**: Added `timeouts` module to public API for user access

## [0.9.1] - 2024-12-19

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL BUG**: Fixed I2C 7-bit address handling. Previously, 7-bit addresses were sent directly to the device without proper formatting for the I2C wire protocol. Addresses must be shifted left by 1 bit to create the proper 8-bit wire format where the 7-bit address occupies bits 7:1 and bit 0 is reserved for the R/W flag.
  - **Impact**: This bug caused devices to be addressed at half their intended address (e.g., a device at address 0x50 was actually being addressed as 0x28)
  - **Example**: EEPROM at 0x50 now correctly addressed as 0xA0 on wire instead of 0x50
  - **Breaking Change**: Existing code that was compensating for this bug by using doubled addresses will need to be updated

### Changed
- **Code Organization**: Refactored monolithic `lib.rs` into focused modules for better maintainability:
  - `device.rs` - Device discovery, opening, and management
  - `i2c.rs` - I2C communication functionality  
  - `gpio.rs` - GPIO control and configuration
  - `pwm.rs` - PWM generation and control
  - `interrupt.rs` - GPIO interrupt handling
- Minor API improvements:
  - `gpio_assign_to_edge()` no longer takes a boolean parameter (always assigns to EDGE)
  - `pwm_control()` parameter order changed to `(channel, enable, command)` for better clarity
  - `find_all()` now returns `Result<Vec<_>>` instead of an iterator for better error handling *(removed in v0.10.0, replaced by `find_all_hardware()`)*

### Added
- Comprehensive tests for I2C address format verification
- Detailed module-level documentation
- `REFACTORING.md` documenting the new module structure
- Better error messages and logging throughout

### Technical Details
- I2C 7-bit addresses are now properly converted to 8-bit wire format using left shift
